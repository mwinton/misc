    "Write a function to provide budgeting recommendations to maximize happiness via discretionary spending.\n",

    "- List of expected yearly mandatory expenses\n",
    "\n",

    "- List of recommended discretionary expenditures\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Can't assume each year's income covers that year's expenses; may need to roll funds forward.\n",
    "- The person definitely shouldnâ€™t die (i.e. budget must cover mandatory expenses every year).\n",
    "- Happiness comes from discretionary spending.\n",
    "- Happiness vs. Discretionary expenditures plot starts steep and flattens out.  In other words, the marginal value of each dollar declines over the previous one throughout the year (i.e. 1st dollar generates more happiness than the second.  Second generates more than the third, etc...).\n",
    "- Marginal value of each discretionary dollar resets each year.\n",
    "- Use up all money by end of life."
